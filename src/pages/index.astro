			    <h2>Our Story</h2>
			    <p>
			      Founded in 2025, Loughborough Community Kitchen (LCK) continues the work of the LSU Action Soup Kitchen.
			      We’re a small team of local volunteers and trustees working to tackle food insecurity and bring people together.
			      We are finalising our charitable bank account and insurance so we can accept donations and expand.

			    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
			    <h3>Volunteer</h3>
			    <p>
			      Whether you can cook, wash up, or simply offer a friendly smile, we need helping hands for each session.
			      No special training is required—just a willingness to pitch in.
			      <a href="#" target="_blank">Sign up to volunteer</a>.
			    </p>
			
			    <h3>Sponsor a Session</h3>
			    <p>
			      A company, club, or group of friends can cover the grocery shop for a service or run the kitchen together.
			      It’s a practical way to support local people and build team spirit.
			    </p>
			
			    <h3>Donate</h3>
			    <p>
			      Once our bank account is live, we’ll share details so you can pledge a one-off or regular donation.
